* **Where should installed packages go?**

    The command `kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME` shows where the TeX engine
    will search for packages (kinda like a `PATH`). `kpsewhich <package>.sty`
    will show what package the TeX engine finds (kinda like `which`). `strace`
    shows that it expects a directory structure like `$(kpsewhich
    -var-value=TEXMFHOME)/tex/<package>`

* **Why are quotation marks the wrong way?**

    TeX wants quotes written as <code>``</code> and <code>''</code> for opening
    and closing quotations, respectively.
